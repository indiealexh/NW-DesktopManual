NW-DesktopManual
================

A node webkit application to make simple manuals and information displays.

A very basic set of code based on node-webkit and the foundation framework create crossplatform manuals, tools and displays that have no additional requirements.


You will need to download the node-webkit binarys from https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit to run the code.

Node-Webkit
---
[Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) is an opensource project that combines the power of the Chromium browser (google chrome) and NodeJS to create fast, easy to create desktop applications accross Windows, Mac and linux without the need for additional dependancies.

Please go read the documentation on the [Node-Webkit respository](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)

Foundation CSS Framework
---
Foundation css framework is used to make themeing and scaling easy, please read the documentation on the [foundation website](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

It is comparable to Twitter's Bootstrap framework, but I (Alex) perfer foundation.
