Current Features:

- Auto-Generated Menus based on artciles in the 'Pages' folder
- Large and small modes
- Large and small mode menus for better usability in all situations.

Node-Webkit
---
[Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) is an opensource project that combines the power of the Chromium browser (google chrome) and NodeJS to create fast, easy to create desktop applications accross Windows, Mac and linux without the need for additional dependancies.

Please go read the documentation on the [Node-Webkit respository](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)

Foundation CSS Framework

Foundation css framework is used to make themeing and scaling easy, please read the documentation on the [foundation website](http://foundation.zurb.com/).

It is comparable to Twitter's Bootstrap framework, but I (Alex) perfer foundation.
